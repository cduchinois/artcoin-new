# ArtCoin Will Fix it! 

ArtCoin is where art criticism meets crypto absurdity - a revolutionary platform where users can vote on artwork's merit using $ARTCOIN tokens. It's a decentralized ecosystem combining aesthetic judgment with crypto mechanics, allowing users to submit artwork, participate in daily voting sessions, and earn rewards for predicting community taste. With features like unfair airdrops based on NFT collection taste and an AI art critic, ArtCoin aims to make Web3 weird again.
